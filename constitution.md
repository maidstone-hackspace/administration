4. MEMBERSHIP
-------------
Our aim is to provide and maintain a shared community workspace with manufacturing equipment, offering education, support, and encouragement around Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) to the general public within Maidstone and the surrounding areas. By doing so new skills are learnt and passed on to ensure that creativity and innovation continue.

Membership will be granted to any person(s) seeking to join Maidstone Hackspace, unless specific reasons exist why a person should be prevented from joining. These could include, but are not limited to, previous exclusion from similar groups or where the person's membership would not be in the best interests of the group. In these circumstances, a person's membership will be determined by a vote of the management committee.

Members will be expected to pay membership fees to Maidstone Hackspace. These fees will be set or reviewed at the AGM or if an EGM is called. Any changes to the fees will be agreed by way of voting, as outlined in clause 5.4. In certain circumstances, reduced fees may be offered to members who are unable to pay the full fees, so as to not exclude any person(s). For a member to qualify for a reduced membership fee, they should contact the management committee who will review each request and vote on whether the member qualifies for the reduced fee.

  2. Members may nominate themselves for the role either in writing to the Management Committee prior to the AGM/EGM, or in person at the AGM/EGM.
  3. With the Member's permission, the Management Committee may appoint a Member as an "Interim" Officer of the Committee.  The Member will fulfil the role until the day of the AGM/EGM, at which point all "Interim" appointments will cease.

6. SAFETY
---------
1. The Maidstone Hackspace aims to provide the space and tools for members to work on their own projects. Each member must assess the safety of their own projects, the tools they are using, and the space they are using before starting. Each member is individually responsible for their own safety and their own actions whilst at hackerspace events. Maidstone Hackspace accepts no liability for any injury, death or loss caused by members’ actions, except where required by law.

2. Members put the safety of themselves and other members ahead of all other considerations. Members should not use any tools or equipment that they are not confident in using, or should seek assistance to do so. If an urgent safety risk is identified, members are required to cease all work until the risk is resolved.
    
3. Members must respect the Hackspace by ensuring they clear up their projects when finished and that their work does not cause hazards to others whilst in progress. Members should also respect that some items provided are not to be hacked, and this will be made clear.
