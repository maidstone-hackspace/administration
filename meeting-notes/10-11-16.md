## Other Business
### Permanent Location for the Hackspace
Suggestions are made that the hackspace contact the Chamber of Commerce. Jackie has already attempted to contact them regarding partnering with businesses. Simon will work with Jackie to send a letter.
It was also suggested that a school was contacted although Oly say he has already tried invicta. 
A recommendation to use meetup or eventbrite was made but unfortunately meetup is a monthly fee.
Jackie asks if the hackspace is in the maidstone community center newsletter as they offer free advertising.
Mike might know someone from Linux Format he could contact.
It was also suggested churches are looked into such as St Faiths which offers 11 Parking spaces and is Â£20. Concerns about the lack of internet where raised but we might be able to look into 4G alternatives.
KCC might also be able to mass approach schools on the Hackspaces behalf.
Museum of Kent Wildlife also has a space near the Malta Inn with an activa blacksmith.
We could also use a shipping container under Sainsburys or a building owned by Tony from Hillreed Homes.
